TO DO:
1. UI Refinement (Proper react declarative way) 

2. Rule based Page Diaplay (Student = just view courses and instances, Teacher = view and add but no delete, Admin = all)

3. Updated JAVA code with response and status codes 

4. Show error in view rather than console 

5. There are still logic implementations to be done
